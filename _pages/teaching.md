## Teaching Assistant & Course Development Experience

**Purdue University**

- **CS 381: Analysis of Algorithms** (Fall 2024, Spring 2025, 450+ students)

  - Developed comprehensive homework assignments and exam problems
  - Led weekly discussion sections focusing on algorithm design and analysis
  - Topics: Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, NP-Completeness

- **CS 182: Foundations of Computer Science** (Spring 2023, 800+ students)

  - Created 200+ assessment problems covering discrete mathematics and formal logic
  - Conducted office hours and review sessions for proof techniques and automata theory
  - Topics: Mathematical Logic, Formal Languages, Automata Theory

- **CS 211/311: Competitive Programming 1/2** (Spring 2022, TAd as a freshman at Purdue!)
  - Conducted office hours for programming contest preparation and homework problems.

## Competitive Programming Education

### USACO Instructor - X-Camp Academy (2023 - Present)

- Designed and delivered intensive algorithm courses for USACO preparation
- Developed comprehensive curriculum covering:
  - Graph Algorithms (Shortest Paths, tree DP, spanning trees, etc,)
  - Dynamic Programming (introduction to 2D/3D DP)
  - Data Structures, Divide-and-Conquer paradigms, binary search.
- Created and administered mock USACO contests with original problems
- Conducted individualized mentoring sessions for Silver/Bronze division students

### Problem Setting Experience (2020-2023)

- **ACM-ICPC Indian Regionals**

  - Designed and tested algorithmic problems for multiple regional sites
  - Problems attempted by 500+ teams in official ICPC contests
  - Focus on advanced algorithms and data structures

- **Platform Contributions**
  - [**Codeforces**](https://codeforces.com/contests/writer/saarang): Created Div 2 contests attempted by 20,000+ participants worldwide
  - **CodeChef**: Developed core algorithm problems for rated competitions including the [hardest problem](https://www.codechef.com/LTIME102/problems/MINFUND) in a Div1 contest!
  - **HackerEarth**: Designed technical assessment problems for various challenges.
  - Problems covered: Graph partitioning, dynamic programming optimization, bridge finding, binary search, etc.

### Mentor - UFDS Mentoring Program (2020 - 2023)

- One of the lead mentors for the free mentorship program for Indian Computing Olympiad preparation
- Developed technical infrastructure:
  - Designed content/syllabus website through writing algorithm tutorials and problem solutions.
  - Developed mock problems using problem-setting platform Polygon and automated testing frameworks with custom test generators/validators.
- Conducted algorithm workshops covering specialized Graph Algorithms, Dynamic Programming Optimization (convex hull trick, DnC DP, etc.), Advanced Data Structures (segment trees, sqrt decomposition, among others).

Through these roles, I've developed strong skills in explaining complex technical concepts, creating rigorous assessment materials, and mentoring students at various skill levels. My experience spans from foundational computer science concepts to advanced algorithmic techniques used in competitive programming.
