I've a strong passion for teaching and I've been involved with it since middle school when I conducted a camp for solving rubix cubes first. 

### Teaching Assistant Roles

- CS 381 Analysis of Algorithms (Fall 24, 450+ students)

- CS 182 Foundations of CS (Spring 23, 800+ students)

- CS211/311 Competitive Programming 1/2 (Spring 22)

### Course Development Roles

- CS 381 Analysis of Algorithms (Fall 24, 450+ students): Created homeworks, quiz/exam problems for 400+ students. 

- CS 182 Foundations of CS (Spring 23, 800+ students): Created homeworks, 200+ quiz problems for 800+ students. 

### USACO Tutor at X-Camp Academy (2023 - Present)

I got involved with X-Camp academy during the summer of my freshman year in college. I helped host summer and winter camps in 2023 June, December for high school students in the Bay Area, California. 

These summer camps would involve rigorous problem-solving sessions and classes on competitive programming topics including graph algorithms, greedy, bitmasks, etc. 

I additionally conducted mock test classes for USACO Silver/Bronze students. This involved preparing 10-20 USACO style mock contests/tutorials with a combination of original problems and past Olympiad problems. 

### UFDS Mentoring (2020 - 2023)

UFDS Mentoring was a free program started by a friend of mine to help mentor high school students for the Indian Computing Olympiad. I was one of the primary organizers of the UFDS Mentoring program through 2021-2023. Some of the past blogs for the program are on codeforces/codechef.

As part of the program, I'd prepare mock contests on the Polygon problemsetting platform and build testcases/generators/validators for solutions. I'd conduct lectures on some important topics like dynamic programming, specific graph algorithms, special optimization algorithms, etc.
