My name is Saarang Srinivasan and I'm a senior at Purdue University studying Computer Science. I'm fascinated by problems and have a strong interest in machine learning and algorithms. More specifically, I'm interested in designing efficient and scalable Systems for Machine Learning. 

In the past, I've explored the TinyGrad ML framework, and developed a Translation Validation framework for it (still in the works). This was based on existing works like Alive2/MLIR-tv and implemented using the Python Z3 SMT library.

I've developed optimizations for the TVM AutoScheduler by integrating it with a GNN cost model to predict the runtime of low level tensor programs. Repo/fork available [here](https://github.com/knightron0/tvm-gnn-costmodel). 

I'm an ex-Olympiad Gold Medalist at the Indian National Olympiad in Informatics. I most recently interned at Collins Aerospace where I worked on military flight software verification and testing using formal methods. Before that, I designed system architecture to ensure scalability and CI/CD for AI/IoT products using Kubernetes and Docker for Hacklab Solutions Pvt Ltd.

I'm looking for full time or internship roles in software engineering or machine learning from May 2025.
