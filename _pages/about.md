Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, I'm Saarang. I'm a senior in Computer Science at Purdue University. I'm a well-versed coder and I'm specifically interested in machine learning and algorithms. I'm currently working on projects in ML Systems and Formal Verification. 

I won a Gold Medal at the Indian National Olympiad in Informatics in 2021 ranking 7th in India. I most recently interned at Collins Aerospace where I worked on military flight software verification and testing using formal methods. Before that, I designed system architecture to ensure scalability and CI/CD using Kubernetes and Docker for Hacklab Solutions Pvt Ltd. 

In 2022 and 2023, I represented Purdue in the ECNA International Collegiate Programming Contest Regionals. Additionally, I have been involved with various clubs and organizations including The Data Mine and Competitive Programming Union. 

I'm also extremely passionate about teaching. I've been tutoring high school students for the Indian Computing Olympiad for years and recently started working as a tutor for the USA Computing Olympiad for X-Camp Academy. I was involved in course development for CS182 Discrete Math in Spring 2024 and for CS381 Analysis of Algorithms currently in Fall 2024. I was a teaching assistant for CS211/311 Competitive Programming 1/2 in Spring 2023 as well. 

I'm actively looking for full time or internship opportunities from May 2025 !
