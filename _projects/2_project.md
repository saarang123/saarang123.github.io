I worked with Webee.io as part of the Purdue University Data Mine Corporate Partnership program through 2022-2023. 

We build an IoT and ML based-solution to analyze sensor data to diagnose machine anomalies and failures in real-time.

The heavy duty work in this project involved data cleaning and noise reductionn. We cleaned noisy sensor data with a 93% success rate, using linear regression and GMM clustering.

Our anomaly detection pipeline was built with One-Class SVM and LSTM, achieving 83% accuracy in outlier detection.
